        The default setup process already include the following steps:

            bin/setup master_key                          # Add the Rails master key
            bin/setup env                                 # Define usefull environnment variables
            bin/setup reset                               # Reset development databases (PG, Redis & ES)
            bin/setup test                                # Reset test databases and build assets
            bin/setup test [rspec|parallel|watch|assets]  # Reset only the given subject for testing
            bin/setup submodules                          # Initialize submodules
